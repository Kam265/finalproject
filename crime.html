                <br>

        <h2 class="SecondShow"><u> How To Get Away With Murder</u></h2>

            <h2 class="ThirdShow"><u>Blood Relatives</u></h2>
            <p class="FourthBaby"> Is blood thicker than water? Does family come first? Certainly most would think so because as far as we're concerned, nothing beats family. Blood Relatives however, counters this notion as the 6-season docu-series lifts the mask hiding the most extreme of family secrets. 
                <br>
                
                From betrayal to murder, the viewers get to witness just how, even the most seemingly perfect familes, can easily be torn apart resulting in murders committed within them. Blood Relatives is available for our viewing pleasure on Amazon Prime Video and the channel Investigation Discovery!</p>
